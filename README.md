# Cracking Advanced COCO PUF using Linear Machine Learning Model

## Introduction

This repository contains code and data for the project "Cracking Advanced COCO PUF using Linear Machine Learning Models". The primary goal of this project is to explore the effectiveness of linear machine learning models, specifically LinearSVC and Logistic Regression, in cracking advanced COCO PUFs. Additionally, we analyze the effects of various hyperparameters on training time and accuracy.

## Cracking Simple Arbiter PUF

I used the basic recursive expression of arrival time of upper signal and lower signal to calculate the time taken by the upper signal to reach the finish line.

## Intuition from Simple Arbiter PUF to Crack COCO PUF

A COCO-PUF uses two arbiter PUFs, so I took the expression from the arbiter PUF to calculate the time taken by the upper signal to reach the finish line.
## Effect of Hyperparameters

Detailed analysis of how different hyperparameters affect the performance of LinearSVC and Logistic Regression models when used to crack PUFs. This section will include:
- Training time
- Accuracy

Graphs and tables were used to demonstrate the data.
